                            <p>The sleep cycle can be separated into two parts, NREM (non rapid eye movement) and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which goes through stages throughout the night. </p>
                            <p>Your mood, body, and sleep environment are just important as how much sleep you're getting every night. Your room should be dim with indirect lighting, being both quiet and attractive to sleep in. A cooler ambient temperature also lower your heart rate which leaves REM sleep uninterrupted (Okamoto-Mizuno & Mizuno, 2012).</p>
